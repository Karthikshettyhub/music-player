- Accessible ARIA labels  

## Technologies Used ðŸš€
- **JavaScript** (Core logic for audio control & playlist management)
- **HTML & CSS** (Structure & styling)
- **CSS Generated Using AI** (Since my focus is on JavaScript and backend development, I used AI to generate the CSS styles efficiently.)


## What I Learned 
- Handling **audio elements** in JavaScript.
- Managing **event listeners** for play/pause, next, previous, and shuffle.
- Implementing **playlist sorting and shuffling algorithms**.
- Using **ARIA attributes for accessibility improvements**.
- Automating CSS styling using AI to focus more on JavaScript development.
